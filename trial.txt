The First Readers-Writers problem gives priority to the reader processes. However, this results in 
the starvation of the writers as there is the possibility of new readers always coming in, and the 
writer processes get starved. Similarily, the Second Readers Writers problem gives priority to the 
writers. Similar to above, there is a possibility of readers getting starved. We aim in finding the 

The Solution idea:
Let's first consider a writer process. First the process will check the number of active and waiting 
readers. If both, the number of waiting readers and number of active readers are zero, then the it will 
read away directly. Otherwise, it will wait until a reader process signals and allows that writer to enter.
Once the writer process is done, if it is the last writer, then it will signal and allow all  the writers 
"waiting" readers process to enter. Similarily, the last reader process will signal and allow the "waiting" 
writers processes to enter. 
The solution can be visualized by imagining a room and two benches outside the room for waiting reader and 
writer process. Suppose you are a writer, if there is no reader inside and no reader on the bench, you can 
enter. If there are readers inside, then the last reader before leaving will allow all the writers on the bench 
to enter in the room. Similarily, the last writer to leave the room will allow all the readers on the bench to 
enter.
